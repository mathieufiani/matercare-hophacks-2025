Are You a Treatment Facility?
FindTreatment.gov is authorized by the 21st Century Cures Act (Public Law 114-255, Section 9006; 42 U.S.C. 290bb-36d). SAMHSA endeavors to keep FindTreatment.gov current. All treatment facility information in FindTreatment.gov is updated annually from facility responses to SAMHSA’s National Substance Use and Mental Health Services Survey (N-SUMHSS). New facilities that have completed an abbreviated survey and met all the qualifications are added monthly. Updates to facility names, addresses, telephone numbers, and services are made weekly for facilities informing SAMHSA of changes.

Facilities may request additions or changes to their information by sending an e-mail to FindTreatment@samhsa.hhs.gov, by calling the Behavioral Health Services Information System (BHSIS) Project Office at 1-833-888-1553 (Mon-Fri 8 a.m. - 6 p.m. ET), or by electronic form submission using the FindTreatment.gov online application form (intended for additions of new facilities). Please complete this application form to request that your facility be added to FindTreatment.gov. Find instructions and more information regarding this form.
