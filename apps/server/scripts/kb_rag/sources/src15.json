Help for Partners & Families
If you’ve come to this page, you may be worried that you or someone you care about is suffering from a perinatal mental health  disorder such as depression and anxiety. It can be very confusing, challenging and even painful to watch your spouse, family member or friend react to becoming a parent in ways that you didn’t expect. Please know that the person with depression or anxiety is not to blame and they are just as surprised by what is happening as you are.

Perinatal mental health disorders are treatable with support and professional help.

Below you find information and a list of PSI Services that may be helpful to you, or contact PSI to connect with support and resources.

Specialized Support: PSI has local volunteers who understand the challenges of perinatal mental health conditions and know local resources that may be helpful for you. These volunteers can provide you the opportunity to connect with someone who understands, can answer basic questions about Perinatal Mental Health and can provide information about how to best support a loved one or friend who is going through this challenging experience. Contact a Support Coordinator.

Taking care of yourself
Develop a support team for your family. Ask for help. Say YES when they offer.
Take time for yourself.
Talk to other families who have come through this.
Spend time with your baby to develop your own confidence.

How to help a new parent
Reassure them: this is not their fault; they are not alone; they will get better.
Encourage them to talk about their feelings and listen without judgment.
Help with housework before they ask you.
Encourage them to take time for self-care.  Breaks are a necessity; fatigue is a major contributing factor to worsening symptoms.
Don’t expect them to complete all household tasks just because they are home all day.
Be realistic about what time you’ll be home, and come home on time.
Help them reach out to others for support and treatment.
Schedule some dates with them and work together to find a babysitter.
Offer simple affection and physical comfort, but be patient if they are not up for sex. It’s normal for them to have a low sex drive with depression, and rest and recovery will help to bring it back.

Dealing with their anger and irritability
Do what you can to make sure they eat regularly throughout the day, because low blood sugar results in a low mood and frustration. Have healthy and easy snacks on hand.
Do your best to listen for the real request at the heart of their frustration. Reduce conflict by telling them, “I know we can work this out. I am listening.”
Keep the lines of communication open. Verbalize your feelings instead of distancing from them. It is helpful to take a break if your tempers are hot, but do get back to communicating.
If they are expressing anger in such a way that you can’t stay supportive, you might say something like, “I want to listen to you. I know this is important, but I’m having a hard time because you’re so mad at me. Can we take a break and talk about it later?”
Ask them how you can help right now. If they don’t know, make some suggestions.

It is important to know that you are not alone, and that Perinatal Mental Health Disorders are treatable.
