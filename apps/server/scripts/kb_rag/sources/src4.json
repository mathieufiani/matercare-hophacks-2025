Perinatal/Postpartum Psychosis Help
Perinatal Psychosis (Pregnancy, Post-Loss, and Postpartum)
Postpartum Psychosis (PPP), also known as Perinatal Psychosis, is a serious PMH disorder that usually has an onset in the first 2-weeks (but up to a year). Postpartum Psychosis occurs in approximately 1 to 2 out of every 1,000 deliveries.   Review the information below to learn more about PPP.

An active case of Postpartum Psychosis is considered an emergency, and you should reach out to one of the numbers listed below. It is important to stay with the perinatal individual and the child to ensure everyone’s safety.

Postpartum Psychosis is treatable, and help is available. You do not need a diagnosis to reach out for help.

Symptoms
Symptoms of perinatal psychosis can include:

Delusions or strange beliefs
Hallucinations (seeing or hearing things that aren’t there)
Feeling very agitated
Hyperactivity or having more energy than usual
Severe depression or lack of emotion
Decreased need for or inability to sleep
Paranoia and suspiciousness
Rapid mood swings
Difficulty communicating at times
Immediate treatment for a person going through psychosis is imperative. Individuals experiencing PP are at higher risk of harming themselves or others (including their infant); however, it should be noted that the vast majority do not. This is because the individual experiencing psychosis is experiencing a break from reality. In their psychotic state, the delusions and beliefs make sense to them; delusions feel very real and are often religious. Immediate treatment for someone going through psychosis is imperative.

It is also important to know that many survivors of perinatal psychosis never experienced delusions containing violent commands. Delusions take many forms, and not all of them are destructive. The majority of individuals who experience perinatal psychosis do not harm themselves or anyone else. However, there is always the risk of danger because psychosis includes delusional thinking and irrational judgment, and this is why this illness must be quickly assessed, treated, and carefully monitored by a trained healthcare or perinatal mental health professional.

Perinatal psychosis is temporary and treatable with professional help, but it is an emergency, and it is essential that you receive immediate help. If you feel you or someone you know may be suffering from this illness, know that it is not your fault and you are not to blame. It is important to stay with the perinatal individual and the child to ensure everyone’s safety. Call your doctor or an emergency crisis hotline right away so that you can get the help you need.

Risk Factors
The most significant risk factor for perinatal/pospartum psychosis is a personal or family history of bipolar disorder, or a previous psychotic episode. It may also include prolonged lack of sleep (for instance going days without any sleep)

Treatment Options
The majority of individuals who experience perinatal psychosis do not harm themselves or anyone else. However, there is always the risk of danger because psychosis includes delusional thinking and irrational judgment.
