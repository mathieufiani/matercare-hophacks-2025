ABSTRACT
Background: Pregnancy and childbirth are vulnerable periods for women’s mental
health, with common occurrences of postnatal depression (PPD), postpartum
post-traumatic stress symptoms (PP-Ptss) and postnatal severe fear of childbirth
(PP-FOc). While previous trauma is linked to higher rates of postpartum psychological
difficulties, the mechanisms and variations by parity and sociodemographic factors
remain poorly understood. the aim of this study was to compare the prevalence of PPD
symptoms, postnatal post-traumatic stress disorder (PP-PtsD), PP-Ptss and PP-FOc
between women with a history of trauma and those without. Additionally, the study
aimed to analyse the prevalence of previous trauma and postnatal mental health
problems in subgroups of primi- and multiparous women, and to investigate how
trauma influenced mental health in relation to sociodemographic characteristics.
Methods: this was a cross-sectional study including 619 women who had given birth
at five maternity clinics in sweden. Data for the survey were collected online using
validated instruments to measure PPD, PP-PtsD, PP-Ptss and PP-FOc. Data were
analysed using chi-squared tests, independent t-tests and uni- and multivariable
regression.
Results: Women with a trauma history (n = 298) showed significantly higher rates of
PPD (26% vs. 13%) and PtsD (5% vs. 2%) than those without a trauma history (n = 321).
Previous trauma, age and parity significantly influenced postnatal outcomes, with
trauma having the most substantial impact.
Conclusions: A history of trauma is correlated to higher risk of postpartum mental
health problems, while previous births may offer some protection, especially against
PP-Ptss and PP-FOc. early identification and targeted support for women with trauma
histories are recommended.
PLAIN LANGUAGE SUMMARY
this study looked at how traumatic experiences earlier in life may be correlated to a
woman’s mental health after giving birth. We compared how common depression,
stress and fear of childbirth were among women with and without a history of trauma.
We also examined whether factors like age and if it was the woman’s first baby made
a difference for mental health.
the study included 619 women from five maternity clinics in sweden. After giving
birth, the women answered online questions about how they were feeling mentally
and emotionally. the results showed that women who had experienced trauma in the
past were more likely to feel depressed or stressed after giving birth than those who
had not.
the study also found that younger women and first-time mothers were at higher risk
for mental health problems after childbirth, especially if they had a history of trauma.
these women may need extra care and support during pregnancy and after the baby
is born.

Introduction
Pregnancy and childbirth are psychologically vulnerable periods for many women (robertson-blackmore
et al. 2013). After childbirth, increased physiological stress raises the risk of mental health problems,
which can affect both mother and child. these challenges are associated with lower breastfeeding rates
(cook et al. 2018, Garthus-Niegel et al. 2018), poorer infant development (Junge et al. 2017) and weak-
ened mother–infant bonding (Kjerulff et al. 2021).
the spectrum of postnatal mental health problems includes postnatal depression (PPD), postnatal
post-traumatic stress disorder (PP-PtsD) and postnatal severe fear of childbirth (PP-FOc). PPD, the most
recognised condition, is characterised by depressed mood and behavioural changes occurring within four
weeks after childbirth according to DsM criteria (Liu et al. 2022). However, many studies use broader
definitions that extend onset to within the first year postpartum. Prevalence rates vary worldwide
between 4 and 64% (roshaidai Mohd Arifin et al. 2018). PPD symptoms are strong risk factors for PP-PtsD
and vice versa (Liu et al. 2022). Postpartum post-traumatic stress symptoms (PP-Ptsss) – though not
meeting full criteria for PtsD – affect 20–30% of women (Davies et al. 2008). PP-PtsD affects around 3%
(Grekin and O’Hara 2014, Ayers et al. 2016, stén et al. 2023), and PP-FOc is present in 15–22% of post-
partum women (Nilsson et al. 2018). these figures are not mutually exclusive, as symptom overlap and
comorbidity between these conditions are common.
A key contributor to mental health problems is previous trauma exposure, including childhood mal-
treatment, which significantly increases vulnerability (Williams et al. 2016). interpersonal factors such as
psychological and physical violence also elevate the risk (Pico-Alfonso et al. 2006). social support plays a
critical protective role; thus, its absence is linked to poorer postnatal mental health outcomes (sumner
et al. 2011, Horsch et al. 2024). Additionally, other stressful life events can compound these risks during
the postpartum period (sit and Wisner 2009).
the American Psychiatric Association (2013) defines trauma primarily as a life-threatening experi-
ence; however, as van der Kolk (2000) emphasises, individual perceptions of what constitutes trauma
are highly subjective. Notably, studies in Western countries report that between 71% and 81% of
individuals experience at least one traumatic event in their lifetime (Frans et al. 2005, Knipscheer
et al. 2020).
A growing body of research underscores the impact of past trauma on postnatal mental health, yet
the mechanisms remain complex. the biopsychosocial model explains how biological, psychological and
social factors interact to influence psychological distress (O’Hara and Wisner 2014). complementing this,
stress sensitisation theory suggests that early life adversity can increase physiological and emotional sen-
sitivity to later stressors, making traumatised individuals more vulnerable to mental health symptoms
during childbirth and postpartum (McLaughlin et al. 2010). these frameworks guide our study by framing
trauma history and sociodemographic risk factors as interacting elements that may increase vulnerability
to postnatal mental health problems. therefore, we hypothesise that women with a history of trauma
will have higher prevalence of postnatal mental health symptoms, and that sociodemographic risk fac-
tors will further amplify this risk.
Given the high prevalence of both traumatic experiences and childbirth among individuals of repro-
ductive age, understanding the associations between trauma and mental health in the postnatal period
is crucial. Although emerging evidence suggests that trauma history is associated with increased risk for
postnatal psychological problems, research in this area remains limited. this study contributes important
knowledge by examining how past trauma relate to specific postnatal mental health outcomes and how
these associations may differ between primiparous and multiparous women or vary across sociodemo-
graphic groups.
the present study aimed to:
(a) compare the prevalence of PPD, PP-PtsD, PP-Ptss and PP-FOc in women with and without a
history of trauma; (b) examine the prevalence of trauma and mental health symptoms by parity
(primiparous vs. multiparous); and (c) examine how trauma influence mental health in relation to
sociodemographic characteristics.

Methods
Design
this cross-sectional, multi-centre study is part of the swedish arm of the international survey of
childbirth-related trauma (iNtersect 2023).
Procedure
the study includes participants from five maternity clinics in southern sweden. the clinics were located
in cities of varying sizes and sociodemographic characteristics. the inclusion criteria were mothers aged
18 years or older who had given birth to a living baby between 6 and 16 weeks prior. Following ethical
and managerial approval, the authors screened for eligibility and subsequently received the personal
security numbers of all women who met the inclusion criteria. Out of all these women, 2000 were ran-
domly selected and sent an invitation letter to participate. the invitation letter contained information
about the study, a personal identification code, and a link to a digital online questionnaire. by entering
their personal code on the first page of the survey, participants provided their digital written informed
consent to participate in the study. A reminder, including a printed version of the questionnaire, was
sent to those who had not responded within three weeks. Participants who completed the printed ques-
tionnaire provided their written informed consent via a signed consent form. Data were collected
between september 2021 and January 2022.
the survey consisted of 116 questions, including sociodemographic and obstetric variables (age, par-
ity, mode of birth, educational level and income), a question on trauma history, and validated instru-
ments to measure PPD, PP-PtsD, PP-Ptss and PP-FOc. We obtained permissions to use the instruments
in this study.
Trauma history
Previous trauma was measured using the trauma checklist from the Post-traumatic stress Diagnostic
scale, which includes a range of traumatic events such as severe diseases, physical assault, sexual abuse,
experiences of military conflicts, childhood abuse, grave accidents and natural disasters (Foa et al. 1997).
Participants indicated whether they had experienced each trauma type prior to the current childbirth
and could add any self-defined trauma not listed on the scale.
in addition, trauma related specifically to previous childbirth experiences was assessed separately with
the question: ‘Did you experience the second/any of the other births as traumatic?’.
Instruments
Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS)
the ePDs is a well-established screening tool for PPD, consisting of 10 items rated on a four-point Likert
scale from 0 to 3, with higher scores indicating more depressive symptoms (cox et al. 1987). Probable
clinically relevant depressive symptoms were defined as a score of ≥13 on the ePDs, based on swedish
validation studies (rubertsson et al. 2011). the ePDs has been translated into swedish and validated
(Wickberg and Hwang 1996).
The City Birth Trauma Scale (CityBiTS)
the citybits is a 29-item self-report instrument assessing childbirth-related post-traumatic stress symp-
toms based on DsM-5 criteria (Ayers et al. 2018). items are answered using yes/no or a four-point Likert
scale from 0 to 3. Questions 3–22 cover four PtsD symptom clusters: re-experiencing, avoidance, hyper-
arousal and negative cognition. to meet PP-PtsD criteria, specific symptom thresholds must be met in
each cluster, with symptoms lasting at least four weeks. total scores range from 0 to 60, with higher
scores indicating greater symptom severity. the swedish version was validated in 2022 (stén et al. 2023).
4 H. GrUNDstrÖM et AL.
Wijma Delivery Experience Questionnaire – version B (W-DEQ-B)
PP-FOc was assessed with the W-DeQ-b, a 33-item scale on childbirth-related fear. Participants rate each state-
ment on a six-point Likert scale from 0 (not at all) to 5 (extremely), with some items reverse-coded. total
scores range from 0 to 165, with higher scores indicating greater fear of childbirth; a score of ≥85 typically
denotes severe PP-FOc (O’connell et al. 2017). the W-DeQ-b has been validated in swedish (Wijma et al. 1998).
Statistical analyses
statistical analyses were performed using ibM sPss version 28.0 (Armonk, Ny). Occasional missing data
in the instruments were replaced using mean imputation. this approach was chosen because the pro-
portion of missing data was low, which helps minimise bias and preserve statistical power.
the sample size was determined based on a sub study within iNtersect, which aimed to validate the
citybits in a swedish context. For that validation study, a minimum of 250 participants was required to
ensure sufficient statistical power for psychometric analyses. Given a low expected response rate, a total
of 2000 participants were invited.
Prevalence rates of PPD, PP-PtsD and severe PP-FOc were compared between trauma-exposed partic-
ipants and those with no trauma history using chi-squared and Fisher’s exact tests. independent t-tests
assessed differences between trauma-exposed and non-exposed groups on numeric postnatal mental
health scales. statistical significance was set at p < .05.
Univariate and multiple regression analyses examined the impact of previous trauma and sociodemo-
graphic factors on postnatal illness. symptoms of PPD, Ptss and PP-FOc were used as continuous vari-
ables to capture the full range of symptom severity. Determinants with significant p values in the
univariate analysis were further analysed in multiple regression using an ‘enter’ model to identify inde-
pendent factors influencing postnatal illness. the following nominal variables were dichotomised for the
regression analyses: history of trauma (yes/no), previous childbirth (yes/no), higher education (university
degree) (yes/no) and being born outside sweden (yes/no). Age was treated as a continuous variable. to
assess multicollinearity among the independent variables included in the regression analyses, collinearity
diagnostics were conducted. All variables demonstrated acceptable tolerance values (>0.1) and variance
inflation factor (ViF) values below 5, indicating no significant multicollinearity, supporting the validity of
the regression model (Kim 2019).
the regression coefficients (β) indicate the average change in the outcome variable (PPD, PP-Ptss and
PP-FOc score) for every 1-unit change in the determinant while keeping all the other determinants constant.
Ethical approval
the study was approved by the swedish ethical review Authority on 20 August 2021 (Dnr 2021-03968).
it is registered in clinical trials, Nct06207916. All participants gave their informed consent to participate
and the study was made in accordance with the Helsinki Declaration.
Results
Of the 2000 women invited to complete the survey, 619 (31%) participated in the study, with 298 (48%)
reporting a history of trauma. A significant difference in parity was observed between the two study
groups: 45% of participants with a history of trauma were primiparous, compared to 63% of those with
no trauma history (p = <.001). Further, participants with a previous trauma exposure were significantly
older, averaging 33.5 years (±4.6) compared to 32.1 years (±4.3) in the non-exposed group (p = <.001).
No other sociodemographic variables showed significant differences between the groups. Among all
multiparas, 108 (38%) reported a previous traumatic childbirth experience. the clinical and sociodemo-
graphic characteristics are detailed in table 1.
As shown in table 2, the three most common types of traumas reported by participants were previous
traumatic childbirth, life-threatening illnesses and sexual abuse. some women had experienced multiple
types of traumas; therefore, the percentages presented in table 2 are not cumulative.

table 3 shows the prevalence of postnatal mental health problems in the total sample and in those
with and without a history of trauma. Among participants with a trauma history, significantly more
women 19% (n = 57) reported depressive symptoms indicating PPD, compared to 8% (n = 26) in the
non-trauma group (p = <.001). For PP-PtsD, 5% (n = 16) of trauma-exposed participants met the diag-
nostic criteria, versus 2% (n = 7) of the non-exposed group (p = .036).
the prevalence of severe PP-FOc was similar between groups: 13% (n = 38) among women with a
history of trauma and 10% (n = 33) among those without trauma (p = .322). When analysing mean
scores for PPD, PP-Ptss and PP-FOc as continuous variables, women with a trauma history had signifi-
cantly higher mean scores across all three measures (p = <.001, p = <.001 and p = .042, respectively).
When stratifying the total sample based on parity, primiparous women with a history of trauma had a
significantly higher proportion of PPD and PP-PtsD compared to primiparas without trauma: 24% (n = 32)

versus 10% (n = 21) for PPD (p = .001), and 9% (n = 12) versus 3% (n = 6) for PP-PtsD (p = .024). similarly,
trauma-exposed primiparas had higher mean scores of PPD and PP-Ptss compared to non-exposed prim-
iparas: mean 8 (sD ± 6) versus mean 6 (sD ± 5) (p = .002) for PPD and mean 12 (sD ± 11) versus mean
8 (sD ± 9) for PP-Ptss (p = <.001). However, there were no significant differences in number of partici-
pants fulfilling the diagnostic criteria or mean scores for PP FOc between the two groups.
considering multiparous women, our results show a significantly higher proportion of those with a
history of trauma meeting the diagnostic criteria for PPD compared to those without trauma: 15% (n = 25)
versus 4% (n = 5) (p = .003). in addition, when analysing the mean scores on each instrument, multipa-
rous women with a history of trauma scored significantly higher on all three instruments: mean 7 (sD ± 5)
versus mean 4 (sD ± 4) (p = <.001), for PPD mean 8 (sD ± 7) versus mean 4 (sD ± 5) (p = <.001) for
PP-Ptss, and mean 51 versus mean 40 (p = <.001) for PP-FOc.these findings are summarised in table 4.
the univariate regression analyses identified several determinants that were significant and used in
the subsequent multivariable regressions. History of trauma was associated with higher PPD scores
(β = 1.92, 95% ci [1.11–2.72],p = <.001), while increasing age (β = −0.14, 95% ci [−0.23 to −0.48],
p = .003), and parity (β = −0.97, 95% ci [−1.78 to −0.15], p = .020) were associated with lower PPD scores.
For PP-Ptss and PP-FOc, only history of trauma and parity emerged as significant predictors. History
of trauma was significantly associated with increased PP-Ptss (β = 3.07, 95%ci [1.70–4.44], p = <.001)
and higher PP-FOc scores (β = 4.90, 95% ci [0.18–9.61],p = .042). Parity was associated with lower
PP-Ptss (β = −3.32, 95% ci [−4.69 to −1.94],p = <.001) and PP-FOc scores (β = −8.41, 95% ci [−13.10
to −3.72], p = <.001).
the results of the multiple regression analyses revealed that previous trauma had a significant and
independent influence heightening the score of all three outcomes: PPD (β = 2.31, 95% ci [1.51–3.13],
p = <.001), PP-Ptss (β = 3.82, 95% ci [2.46–5.18], p = <.001) and PP-FOc (β = 6.72, 95% ci 1.98–11.47],
p = .006). increasing age had a low influence on PPD (β = −0.15, 95% ci [−0.24 to −0.05], p = .002), while
having given birth before was slightly protective against PPD (β = −1.01, 95%ci [−1.86 to −0.18],
p = .017). being multiparous was found to be protective against PP-Ptss (β = −4.03, 95% ci [−5.40 to
−2.67], p = <.001) and PP-FOc (β = −9.68, 95% ci [−14.43 to −4.93], p = <.001).
Discussion
Overall, women with a history of trauma reported higher prevalence and mean scores of PPD and
PP-Ptss across parity groups, while differences in PP-FOc were more pronounced among multiparous
women. these findings provide the context for examining how trauma impacts postnatal mental health.
Our results indicate that primiparous women with a history of trauma are at a comparatively higher risk
for postpartum mental health problems, particularly PPD and PP-Ptss, relative to multiparas. this high-
lights their heightened vulnerability during the transition to parenthood and the importance of targeted
support for this group.
the overall prevalence of PPD in this study was higher than reported in a previous Danish study
(Johannsen et al. 2016) but in line with previous international studies (choi and sikkema 2016). Our
PP-PtsD prevalence was consistent with rates from a meta-analysis in general populations (Horsch
et al. 2024).

Our results show that women with a trauma history more often met diagnostic criteria for PP-PtsD
compared to non-exposed women, consistent with previous research (Horsch et al. 2024). this suggests
that previous trauma history may be linked to elevated risk of general mental ill health, particularly for
PP-PtsD and PPD following the current birth, possibly due to sensitisation from re-traumatisation. in the
context of childbirth, re-traumatisation refers to the triggering or re-experiencing of distress from a pre-
vious traumatic event – such as sexual abuse, violence or a prior traumatic birth – through aspects of
the birth process or care environment. co-morbidity between untreated PtsD and depression is also
high (radell et al. 2020, Liu et al. 2022), with evidence showing that treating PtsD has a beneficial effect
on co-occurring depressive symptoms, while addressing depression alone does not reduce traumatic
stress symptoms (radell et al. 2020). Given the association between trauma history and PPD, comorbid
PtsD should be considered in planning postpartum interventions. For women who become pregnant
again, a tailored birth plan may help minimise re-traumatisation risks. Further research is needed to
develop effective interventions for this group, both postpartum and in preparation for future pregnancies.
in the total study population, women with a history of trauma reported higher levels of PP-FOc than
those without trauma; however, no significant difference was observed in the proportion reaching severe
PP-FOc. this is interesting, as previous studies have shown trauma to be a risk factor for severe FOc
during pregnancy (Grundström et al. 2023, Porthan et al. 2023). this may reflect the timing of assess-
ment, as our measurements were taken postpartum, after the feared event had occurred and was no
longer perceived as an immediate threat. Additionally, individuals with traumatic memories may use
avoidance as a coping strategy, perhaps leading them to dismiss the idea of a future pregnancy and
birth, which could help explain these results.
Among primiparous women, there was a significant increase in the prevalence of PPD and PP-PtsD
among those with a history of trauma. this suggests that these individuals may enter pregnancy and
childbirth with poorer mental health, which could contribute to higher psychological distress, as sup-
ported by previous research. However, prior trauma did not impact PP-FOc in first-time mothers. this
may reflect that the childbirth experience itself plays a more critical role in shaping PP-FOc than histor-
ical trauma, and even within high-risk groups, women may still have positive birth experiences
(Grundström et al. 2021).
in multiparous women, those reporting previous trauma – some stemming from earlier traumatic
births – had higher levels of PPD, PP-PtsD and PP-FOc compared with multiparous controls. Although
few women exceeded the cut-off for severe PP-FOc, mean scores were significantly higher, suggesting
that prior traumatic childbirths may have a stronger influence on PP-FOc than other types of traumas.
it is notable that primiparous women scored higher than multiparous women on all mental health
measures, both among those with and without a history of trauma. thus, mental health problems may
be more of a struggle during the first transition to parenthood, which is supported by previous research
(young et al. 2019). Additionally, previous positive birth experiences may serve as a protective factor for
multiparous women, reducing fears and enhancing self-efficacy during subsequent births, which could
help mitigate mental health issues after the current birth. this contrasts with first-time mothers, who
may face greater anxiety and uncertainty (Karlström et al. 2015, Wong et al. 2015). Overall, these findings
suggest that parity may moderate the impact of trauma, with first-time mothers being more vulnerable
to postpartum mental health problems, while prior birth experiences may buffer multiparous women
against similar difficulties.
Our findings support the stress sensitisation theory, suggesting that prior trauma increases vulnerabil-
ity to postpartum mental health difficulties. consistent with the stress sensitisation hypothesis, women
with a history of trauma showed higher rates of PPD, PP-PtsD and PP-FOc compared to those without
trauma history. Notably, in multiparous women, previous traumatic childbirth emerged as particularly
impactful, suggesting that not only early life trauma but also trauma experienced during earlier repro-
ductive events may shape subsequent vulnerability.
Our results suggest that identifying women with a history of trauma during pregnancy and postpar-
tum may be important for offering appropriate support during the transition to parenthood. routine
screening for trauma and psychological distress should be recommended in early antenatal care, using
validated and sensitive tools (Howard et al. 2014). importantly, such screening should be accompanied
by clear care pathways and access to appropriate support. incorporating trauma-informed care – where

providers are trained to recognise and respond to trauma while minimising the risk of re-traumatisation
– may be a valuable approach within maternity services (seng et al. 2008, Andersson et al. 2024).
interventions such as continuity of care, trauma-informed childbirth preparation, and access to psycho-
logical support could be beneficial for this group (WHO 2022). in practice, this may include ensuring that
midwives receive training in trauma-informed approaches (Andersson et al. 2024), offering a consistent
care provider throughout pregnancy and birth (sandall et al. 2015), and facilitating access to peer sup-
port programs or specialised counselling services (shah et al. 2024).
Strengths and weaknesses
A strength of this study is its large sample size (n = 619), providing a robust basis for statistical analyses.
the study was conducted across five maternity clinics in southern sweden, capturing a range of socio-
demographic characteristics. Validated instruments were used to assess mental health outcomes, and the
ePDs cut-off (≥13) was chosen based on validation in sweden. the prevalence of depressive symptoms
may vary depending on the ePDs cut-off used; however, we modelled the scale as a continuous variable
in regression analyses to reduce dependence on dichotomisation.
the response rate was relatively low (31%), which may have introduced self-selection bias, potentially
affecting both prevalence estimates and observed associations. Factors contributing to the low response
rate include the sensitive nature of the study, postpartum recruitment, emotional discomfort, stigma,
language difficulties, time constraints and perceived lack of relevance. Although a higher response rate
might not have substantially altered the main associations, the findings may not fully generalise to the
broader postpartum population. individuals experiencing trauma or psychological distress may have
been more motivated to participate, potentially inflating prevalence estimates (Gavin et al. 2015).
Other limitations include the cross-sectional design, which limits causal inference, and measurement
constraints, such as the trauma assessment not capturing severity or timing, and reliance on self-reported
symptoms, which may introduce recall or reporting bias. importantly, potential confounders – such as social
support, ongoing stress and psychiatric history – were not controlled, which could influence observed asso-
ciations. Future studies should include validated measures of social support and psychiatric history to bet-
ter account for these factors. Finally, the high educational level of participants (80% university degree
holders) may limit representativeness relative to the general population in sweden (statistics sweden 2021).
Conclusions
Our findings indicate that a history of trauma is associated with a higher risk of postpartum mental
health problems, while having given birth previously may offer some protective effects, particularly
against PP-Ptss and PP-FOc. clinically, these findings highlight the need for early identification of women
with trauma histories and provision of targeted support during pregnancy and postpartum.
