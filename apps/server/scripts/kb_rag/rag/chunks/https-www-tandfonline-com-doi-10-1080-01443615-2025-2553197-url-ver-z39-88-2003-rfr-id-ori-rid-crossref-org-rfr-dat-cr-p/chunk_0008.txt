Ethical approval
the study was approved by the swedish ethical review Authority on 20 August 2021 (Dnr 2021-03968).
it is registered in clinical trials, Nct06207916. All participants gave their informed consent to participate
and the study was made in accordance with the Helsinki Declaration.
Results
Of the 2000 women invited to complete the survey, 619 (31%) participated in the study, with 298 (48%)
reporting a history of trauma. A significant difference in parity was observed between the two study
groups: 45% of participants with a history of trauma were primiparous, compared to 63% of those with
no trauma history (p = <.001). Further, participants with a previous trauma exposure were significantly
older, averaging 33.5 years (±4.6) compared to 32.1 years (±4.3) in the non-exposed group (p = <.001).
No other sociodemographic variables showed significant differences between the groups. Among all
multiparas, 108 (38%) reported a previous traumatic childbirth experience. the clinical and sociodemo-
graphic characteristics are detailed in table 1.
As shown in table 2, the three most common types of traumas reported by participants were previous
traumatic childbirth, life-threatening illnesses and sexual abuse. some women had experienced multiple
types of traumas; therefore, the percentages presented in table 2 are not cumulative.

table 3 shows the prevalence of postnatal mental health problems in the total sample and in those
with and without a history of trauma. Among participants with a trauma history, significantly more
women 19% (n = 57) reported depressive symptoms indicating PPD, compared to 8% (n = 26) in the
non-trauma group (p = <.001). For PP-PtsD, 5% (n = 16) of trauma-exposed participants met the diag-
nostic criteria, versus 2% (n = 7) of the non-exposed group (p = .036).
the prevalence of severe PP-FOc was similar between groups: 13% (n = 38) among women with a
history of trauma and 10% (n = 33) among those without trauma (p = .322). When analysing mean
scores for PPD, PP-Ptss and PP-FOc as continuous variables, women with a trauma history had signifi-
cantly higher mean scores across all three measures (p = <.001, p = <.001 and p = .042, respectively).
