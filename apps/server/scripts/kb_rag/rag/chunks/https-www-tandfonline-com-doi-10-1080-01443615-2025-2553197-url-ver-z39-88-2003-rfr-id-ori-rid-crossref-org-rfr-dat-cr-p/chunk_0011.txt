in multiparous women, those reporting previous trauma – some stemming from earlier traumatic
births – had higher levels of PPD, PP-PtsD and PP-FOc compared with multiparous controls. Although
few women exceeded the cut-off for severe PP-FOc, mean scores were significantly higher, suggesting
that prior traumatic childbirths may have a stronger influence on PP-FOc than other types of traumas.
it is notable that primiparous women scored higher than multiparous women on all mental health
measures, both among those with and without a history of trauma. thus, mental health problems may
be more of a struggle during the first transition to parenthood, which is supported by previous research
(young et al. 2019). Additionally, previous positive birth experiences may serve as a protective factor for
multiparous women, reducing fears and enhancing self-efficacy during subsequent births, which could
help mitigate mental health issues after the current birth. this contrasts with first-time mothers, who
may face greater anxiety and uncertainty (Karlström et al. 2015, Wong et al. 2015). Overall, these findings
suggest that parity may moderate the impact of trauma, with first-time mothers being more vulnerable
to postpartum mental health problems, while prior birth experiences may buffer multiparous women
against similar difficulties.
Our findings support the stress sensitisation theory, suggesting that prior trauma increases vulnerabil-
ity to postpartum mental health difficulties. consistent with the stress sensitisation hypothesis, women
with a history of trauma showed higher rates of PPD, PP-PtsD and PP-FOc compared to those without
trauma history. Notably, in multiparous women, previous traumatic childbirth emerged as particularly
impactful, suggesting that not only early life trauma but also trauma experienced during earlier repro-
ductive events may shape subsequent vulnerability.
Our results suggest that identifying women with a history of trauma during pregnancy and postpar-
tum may be important for offering appropriate support during the transition to parenthood. routine
screening for trauma and psychological distress should be recommended in early antenatal care, using
validated and sensitive tools (Howard et al. 2014). importantly, such screening should be accompanied
by clear care pathways and access to appropriate support. incorporating trauma-informed care – where

providers are trained to recognise and respond to trauma while minimising the risk of re-traumatisation
– may be a valuable approach within maternity services (seng et al. 2008, Andersson et al. 2024).
interventions such as continuity of care, trauma-informed childbirth preparation, and access to psycho-
logical support could be beneficial for this group (WHO 2022). in practice, this may include ensuring that
midwives receive training in trauma-informed approaches (Andersson et al. 2024), offering a consistent
care provider throughout pregnancy and birth (sandall et al. 2015), and facilitating access to peer sup-
port programs or specialised counselling services (shah et al. 2024).
