Introduction
Pregnancy and childbirth are psychologically vulnerable periods for many women (robertson-blackmore
et al. 2013). After childbirth, increased physiological stress raises the risk of mental health problems,
which can affect both mother and child. these challenges are associated with lower breastfeeding rates
(cook et al. 2018, Garthus-Niegel et al. 2018), poorer infant development (Junge et al. 2017) and weak-
ened mother–infant bonding (Kjerulff et al. 2021).
the spectrum of postnatal mental health problems includes postnatal depression (PPD), postnatal
post-traumatic stress disorder (PP-PtsD) and postnatal severe fear of childbirth (PP-FOc). PPD, the most
recognised condition, is characterised by depressed mood and behavioural changes occurring within four
weeks after childbirth according to DsM criteria (Liu et al. 2022). However, many studies use broader
definitions that extend onset to within the first year postpartum. Prevalence rates vary worldwide
between 4 and 64% (roshaidai Mohd Arifin et al. 2018). PPD symptoms are strong risk factors for PP-PtsD
and vice versa (Liu et al. 2022). Postpartum post-traumatic stress symptoms (PP-Ptsss) – though not
meeting full criteria for PtsD – affect 20–30% of women (Davies et al. 2008). PP-PtsD affects around 3%
(Grekin and O’Hara 2014, Ayers et al. 2016, stén et al. 2023), and PP-FOc is present in 15–22% of post-
partum women (Nilsson et al. 2018). these figures are not mutually exclusive, as symptom overlap and
comorbidity between these conditions are common.
A key contributor to mental health problems is previous trauma exposure, including childhood mal-
treatment, which significantly increases vulnerability (Williams et al. 2016). interpersonal factors such as
psychological and physical violence also elevate the risk (Pico-Alfonso et al. 2006). social support plays a
critical protective role; thus, its absence is linked to poorer postnatal mental health outcomes (sumner
et al. 2011, Horsch et al. 2024). Additionally, other stressful life events can compound these risks during
the postpartum period (sit and Wisner 2009).
the American Psychiatric Association (2013) defines trauma primarily as a life-threatening experi-
ence; however, as van der Kolk (2000) emphasises, individual perceptions of what constitutes trauma
are highly subjective. Notably, studies in Western countries report that between 71% and 81% of
individuals experience at least one traumatic event in their lifetime (Frans et al. 2005, Knipscheer
et al. 2020).
