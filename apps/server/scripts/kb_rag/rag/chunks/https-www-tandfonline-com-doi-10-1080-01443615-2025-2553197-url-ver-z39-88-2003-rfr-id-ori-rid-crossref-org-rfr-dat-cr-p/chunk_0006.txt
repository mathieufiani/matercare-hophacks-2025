Instruments
Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS)
the ePDs is a well-established screening tool for PPD, consisting of 10 items rated on a four-point Likert
scale from 0 to 3, with higher scores indicating more depressive symptoms (cox et al. 1987). Probable
clinically relevant depressive symptoms were defined as a score of ≥13 on the ePDs, based on swedish
validation studies (rubertsson et al. 2011). the ePDs has been translated into swedish and validated
(Wickberg and Hwang 1996).
The City Birth Trauma Scale (CityBiTS)
the citybits is a 29-item self-report instrument assessing childbirth-related post-traumatic stress symp-
toms based on DsM-5 criteria (Ayers et al. 2018). items are answered using yes/no or a four-point Likert
scale from 0 to 3. Questions 3–22 cover four PtsD symptom clusters: re-experiencing, avoidance, hyper-
arousal and negative cognition. to meet PP-PtsD criteria, specific symptom thresholds must be met in
each cluster, with symptoms lasting at least four weeks. total scores range from 0 to 60, with higher
scores indicating greater symptom severity. the swedish version was validated in 2022 (stén et al. 2023).

Wijma Delivery Experience Questionnaire – version B (W-DEQ-B)
PP-FOc was assessed with the W-DeQ-b, a 33-item scale on childbirth-related fear. Participants rate each state-
ment on a six-point Likert scale from 0 (not at all) to 5 (extremely), with some items reverse-coded. total
scores range from 0 to 165, with higher scores indicating greater fear of childbirth; a score of ≥85 typically
denotes severe PP-FOc (O’connell et al. 2017). the W-DeQ-b has been validated in swedish (Wijma et al. 1998).
