A growing body of research underscores the impact of past trauma on postnatal mental health, yet
the mechanisms remain complex. the biopsychosocial model explains how biological, psychological and
social factors interact to influence psychological distress (Oâ€™Hara and Wisner 2014). complementing this,
stress sensitisation theory suggests that early life adversity can increase physiological and emotional sen-
sitivity to later stressors, making traumatised individuals more vulnerable to mental health symptoms
during childbirth and postpartum (McLaughlin et al. 2010). these frameworks guide our study by framing
trauma history and sociodemographic risk factors as interacting elements that may increase vulnerability
to postnatal mental health problems. therefore, we hypothesise that women with a history of trauma
will have higher prevalence of postnatal mental health symptoms, and that sociodemographic risk fac-
tors will further amplify this risk.
Given the high prevalence of both traumatic experiences and childbirth among individuals of repro-
ductive age, understanding the associations between trauma and mental health in the postnatal period
is crucial. Although emerging evidence suggests that trauma history is associated with increased risk for
postnatal psychological problems, research in this area remains limited. this study contributes important
knowledge by examining how past trauma relate to specific postnatal mental health outcomes and how
these associations may differ between primiparous and multiparous women or vary across sociodemo-
graphic groups.
the present study aimed to:
(a) compare the prevalence of PPD, PP-PtsD, PP-Ptss and PP-FOc in women with and without a
history of trauma; (b) examine the prevalence of trauma and mental health symptoms by parity
(primiparous vs. multiparous); and (c) examine how trauma influence mental health in relation to
sociodemographic characteristics.
