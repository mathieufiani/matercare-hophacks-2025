Discussion
Overall, women with a history of trauma reported higher prevalence and mean scores of PPD and
PP-Ptss across parity groups, while differences in PP-FOc were more pronounced among multiparous
women. these findings provide the context for examining how trauma impacts postnatal mental health.
Our results indicate that primiparous women with a history of trauma are at a comparatively higher risk
for postpartum mental health problems, particularly PPD and PP-Ptss, relative to multiparas. this high-
lights their heightened vulnerability during the transition to parenthood and the importance of targeted
support for this group.
the overall prevalence of PPD in this study was higher than reported in a previous Danish study
(Johannsen et al. 2016) but in line with previous international studies (choi and sikkema 2016). Our
PP-PtsD prevalence was consistent with rates from a meta-analysis in general populations (Horsch
et al. 2024).
Our results show that women with a trauma history more often met diagnostic criteria for PP-PtsD
compared to non-exposed women, consistent with previous research (Horsch et al. 2024). this suggests
that previous trauma history may be linked to elevated risk of general mental ill health, particularly for
PP-PtsD and PPD following the current birth, possibly due to sensitisation from re-traumatisation. in the
context of childbirth, re-traumatisation refers to the triggering or re-experiencing of distress from a pre-
vious traumatic event – such as sexual abuse, violence or a prior traumatic birth – through aspects of
the birth process or care environment. co-morbidity between untreated PtsD and depression is also
high (radell et al. 2020, Liu et al. 2022), with evidence showing that treating PtsD has a beneficial effect
on co-occurring depressive symptoms, while addressing depression alone does not reduce traumatic
stress symptoms (radell et al. 2020). Given the association between trauma history and PPD, comorbid
PtsD should be considered in planning postpartum interventions. For women who become pregnant
again, a tailored birth plan may help minimise re-traumatisation risks. Further research is needed to
develop effective interventions for this group, both postpartum and in preparation for future pregnancies.
in the total study population, women with a history of trauma reported higher levels of PP-FOc than
those without trauma; however, no significant difference was observed in the proportion reaching severe
PP-FOc. this is interesting, as previous studies have shown trauma to be a risk factor for severe FOc
during pregnancy (Grundström et al. 2023, Porthan et al. 2023). this may reflect the timing of assess-
ment, as our measurements were taken postpartum, after the feared event had occurred and was no
longer perceived as an immediate threat. Additionally, individuals with traumatic memories may use
avoidance as a coping strategy, perhaps leading them to dismiss the idea of a future pregnancy and
birth, which could help explain these results.
Among primiparous women, there was a significant increase in the prevalence of PPD and PP-PtsD
among those with a history of trauma. this suggests that these individuals may enter pregnancy and
childbirth with poorer mental health, which could contribute to higher psychological distress, as sup-
ported by previous research. However, prior trauma did not impact PP-FOc in first-time mothers. this
may reflect that the childbirth experience itself plays a more critical role in shaping PP-FOc than histor-
ical trauma, and even within high-risk groups, women may still have positive birth experiences
(Grundström et al. 2021).
