Conclusions
Our findings indicate that a history of trauma is associated with a higher risk of postpartum mental
health problems, while having given birth previously may offer some protective effects, particularly
against PP-Ptss and PP-FOc. clinically, these findings highlight the need for early identification of women
with trauma histories and provision of targeted support during pregnancy and postpartum.
