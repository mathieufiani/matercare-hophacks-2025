Strengths and weaknesses
A strength of this study is its large sample size (n = 619), providing a robust basis for statistical analyses.
the study was conducted across five maternity clinics in southern sweden, capturing a range of socio-
demographic characteristics. Validated instruments were used to assess mental health outcomes, and the
ePDs cut-off (≥13) was chosen based on validation in sweden. the prevalence of depressive symptoms
may vary depending on the ePDs cut-off used; however, we modelled the scale as a continuous variable
in regression analyses to reduce dependence on dichotomisation.
the response rate was relatively low (31%), which may have introduced self-selection bias, potentially
affecting both prevalence estimates and observed associations. Factors contributing to the low response
rate include the sensitive nature of the study, postpartum recruitment, emotional discomfort, stigma,
language difficulties, time constraints and perceived lack of relevance. Although a higher response rate
might not have substantially altered the main associations, the findings may not fully generalise to the
broader postpartum population. individuals experiencing trauma or psychological distress may have
been more motivated to participate, potentially inflating prevalence estimates (Gavin et al. 2015).
Other limitations include the cross-sectional design, which limits causal inference, and measurement
constraints, such as the trauma assessment not capturing severity or timing, and reliance on self-reported
symptoms, which may introduce recall or reporting bias. importantly, potential confounders – such as social
support, ongoing stress and psychiatric history – were not controlled, which could influence observed asso-
ciations. Future studies should include validated measures of social support and psychiatric history to bet-
ter account for these factors. Finally, the high educational level of participants (80% university degree
holders) may limit representativeness relative to the general population in sweden (statistics sweden 2021).
