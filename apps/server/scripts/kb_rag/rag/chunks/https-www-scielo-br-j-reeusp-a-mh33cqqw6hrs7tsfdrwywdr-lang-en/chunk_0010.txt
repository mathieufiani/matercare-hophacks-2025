NURSES’ SKILLS IN NURSING CARE FOR WOMEN WITH PPD INDICATIONS
Skills such as identifying warning signs indicative of PPD, early identification of signs and symptoms, awareness of the importance of multidisciplinary care, active and qualified listening to the patient, and home visits were topics raised in the professionals’ statements.

The woman often shows signs of sadness. Sometimes, during pregnancy, you already notice, sometimes, some signs at the end of pregnancy [...] We usually identify it right after birth, so there is the period. Women often begin to show some signs during prenatal care [...] (E10)

[...] how her sleep is; breastfeeding issues, if she is having difficulty, if she is having pain when breastfeeding; self-esteem issues are also very important for us to know, because when the baby is born, attention turns only to him [...] observing these issues, how her emotions are, if she is having episodes of deep sadness, crying, intrusive thoughts, that kind of thing. (E13)

And what is beyond our reach, we are sharing with the team. (E07)

[...] we also have to arrange a visit to this woman, so as not to leave her completely without a professional for many days, precisely because she will need closer monitoring [...] (E05)

The expanded view of the puerperal woman, observing her as a whole, was also mentioned by the nurses.

[...] we really need to broaden this perspective to see the puerperal woman, to also guide [...] when she arrives there to take the child to do the heel prick test, first I try to do... attend her too, in a comprehensive way (E01)

[...] after we completed the training, I pay more attention to what the patient tells me. (E14)

Health support and guidance, as well as continuous monitoring of signs and symptoms, humanization of care and nursing support, were mentioned as essential factors in the care of postpartum women.

[...] and we, as nurses, continue to accompany this puerperal woman through her difficulties, with guidance [...] (E13)

[...] we have been trying to schedule an appointment for her at least every 15 days, in addition to the weekly appointment with the psychologist. (E14)

[...] I think the main care would be humanization, so that we understand that that woman is going through a delicate moment in her postpartum period [...] (E08)

NURSES’ ATTITUDES IN NURSING CARE FOR WOMEN WITH PPD INDICATIONS
Attitudes such as the active search for knowledge and the professional’s motivation to become better were presented in the statements.

[...] today, with the training, it was good that it directed, brought examples, new things, new bibliographies [...] (E01)

[...]I think it had been a long time since we had such valid training with such dedicated professionals; it was very good, very enriching (E06)

So, I think it’s something we have to improve, change. I think I’ve improved on that, on that issue. (E01)

The nurses’ optimism, the discussions on the topic, and increased assurance in caring for postpartum women were also mentioned.

We discussed it a lot and today I think I try like this, I changed my perspective. (E01)

So, I definitely feel more empowered to serve these women, these postpartum women. (E07)

[...] after the training we received, I felt much more confident about the topic [...] (E12)
