DATA ANALYSIS AND TREATMENT
Sociodemographic and professional data were stored in an Excel® spreadsheet, exported to the software Statistical Package for the Social Sciences (SPSS) (version 29), and a simple descriptive statistical analysis was performed. For the analysis of the statements, they were transcribed in full in a document from Microsoft Word®, and analyzed qualitatively, based on thematic content analysis, by Laurence Bardin, which is based on three stages: 1- pre-analysis, 2- exploration of the material, 3- treatment of the results obtained and interpretation(21). The statements were organized, coded, and categorized with the support of the ATLAS.ti software®, version 24.
