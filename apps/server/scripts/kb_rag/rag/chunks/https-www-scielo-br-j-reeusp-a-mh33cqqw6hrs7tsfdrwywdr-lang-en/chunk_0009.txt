POST-INTERVENTION PHASE
In the post-intervention phase, the impact of the educational intervention was evaluated using the same script as the pre-intervention phase (according to the adopted theoretical framework) on the skills of PHC nurses in providing nursing care for women with signs of postpartum depression. At this stage, the three a priori categories identified in the pre-intervention phase were identified: Nurses’ knowledge about postpartum depression; Nurses’ skills in nursing care for women with signs of postpartum depression; Nurses’ attitudes in nursing care for women with signs of postpartum depression.

NURSES’ KNOWLEDGE ABOUT PPD
This category expresses the improvement in knowledge about PPD and the perception of the importance of using a scale for PPD screening. Furthermore, nurses were able to perceive the prevalence of PPD as a problem and differentiate it from Baby blues.

[...] we can use the scales, there are some scales that are already validated, which we can track among our postpartum women, if any of them have an indication of postpartum depression [...] (E03)

[...] theoretically, I know that we have the scale that was presented to us, for postpartum depression, which is the {Edinburgh} scale [...] (E13)

Well, I know it {PPD} is much more present than I imagined it was. (E02)

[...] observe whether the symptoms will only be present in the first few days and will pass or whether they will persist, so we can characterize it as depression [...] (E10)

[...] I was able to differentiate baby blues from depression. Postpartum depression is a little more serious. It can last from months to 2 years after birth [...] (E12)

After training, nurses better understood the seriousness of the problem and the importance of identifying the signs and symptoms of PPD. Furthermore, they also better understood the undervaluation and underreporting of the disease.

[...] today I know the clinical picture, and I pay more attention after we did the training, I pay more attention to what the patient tells me [...] (E14)

Today, after the course, we gained extensive knowledge about the signs and symptoms [...] And now we can visualize, I can visualize the symptoms during the postpartum consultation (E08)

And it is a disease that often goes unnoticed, often confused with maternal overload and sometimes we don’t give it much value. (E03)

[...] it was a very underreported topic, we didn’t have much information, it wasn’t a concern for the nurses, the gynecologist who provides this care [...] (E08)

It was also noted that professionals were aware of the serious outcomes of PPD, in addition to the universality of the disease.

[...] Reaching the point of more severe depression, reaching the point of attempting self-extermination or even attacking the baby. (E04)

[...] more serious, which can cause greater harm to both the puerperal woman and the baby [...] (E13)
