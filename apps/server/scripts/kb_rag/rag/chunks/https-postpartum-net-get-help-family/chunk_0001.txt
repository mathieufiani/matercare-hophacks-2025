Help for Partners & Families
If you’ve come to this page, you may be worried that you or someone you care about is suffering from a perinatal mental health  disorder such as depression and anxiety. It can be very confusing, challenging and even painful to watch your spouse, family member or friend react to becoming a parent in ways that you didn’t expect. Please know that the person with depression or anxiety is not to blame and they are just as surprised by what is happening as you are.

Perinatal mental health disorders are treatable with support and professional help.
