Consider asking the following questions:

What are the credentials and experience of the therapist? Does the therapist have a specialty?
What approach will the therapist use to help you? Do they practice a particular type of therapy? What is the rationale for the therapy and its evidence base?
Does the therapist have experience in diagnosing and treating the age group (for example, a child) and the specific condition? If the patient is a child, how will parents or caregivers be involved in treatment?
What are the goals of therapy? Does the therapist recommend a specific time frame or number of sessions? How will progress be assessed? What happens if you (or the therapist) feel you aren't starting to improve?
Are medications an option? Is this therapist able to prescribe medications?
Are meetings confidential? How is confidentiality assured? Are there limits to confidentiality?
If you have been in therapy for what feels like a reasonable amount of time and are not getting better, talk to your therapist. You might want to explore other mental health professionals or approaches.

How can I find a therapist?
Many types of professionals offer psychotherapy. Examples include psychiatrists, psychologists, social workers, counselors, and psychiatric nurses. Information on providersâ€™ credentials is available from the National Alliance on Mental Illness  and the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration .
