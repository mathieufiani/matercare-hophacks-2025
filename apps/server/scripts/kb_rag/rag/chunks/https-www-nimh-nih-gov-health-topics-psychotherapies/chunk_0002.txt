In general, the goals of psychotherapy are to gain relief from symptoms, maintain or enhance daily functioning, and improve quality of life.

You or someone you know might seek out psychotherapy for many reasons, including:

Dealing with severe or long-term stress from a job or family situation, the loss of a loved one, or relationship or family problems
Having symptoms with no physical explanation, such as changes in sleep or appetite, low energy, lack of interest or pleasure in activities you once enjoyed, persistent irritability, excessive worry, or a sense of discouragement or hopelessness that wonâ€™t go away
A health care provider suspecting you have or diagnosing you with a mental disorder that is interfering with your life
Supporting a child or family member who has been diagnosed with a condition affecting their mental health
First being examined by a health care provider can help rule out a physical health issue. This step is important because sometimes symptoms, like a change in mood or trouble concentrating, are due to a medical condition.

Psychotherapy and other treatment options
Psychotherapy can be used as an alternative to or alongside medication and other treatment options. Choosing the right treatment plan is based on a person's individual needs and medical situation and should occur under the guidance of a mental health professional.

Even when medication relieves symptoms, psychotherapy can help address specific issues. These might include self-defeating ways of thinking; irrational fears; problems interacting with other people; or difficulty coping with situations at home, school, or work.
