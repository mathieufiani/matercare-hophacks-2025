National advocacy organizations provide information on finding mental health professionals, and some have locators for finding a therapist on their websites. Examples include:

Anxiety & Depression Association of America 
Attention Deficit Disorder Association 
Children and Adults With Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder 
Depression and Bipolar Support Alliance 
International OCD Foundation 
Mental Health America 
National Alliance on Mental Illness 
Note: NIMH does not evaluate the professional qualifications and competencies of individual practitioners listed on these websites. These resources are provided for informational purposes only. They are not comprehensive lists, and an organizationâ€™s inclusion does not constitute an endorsement by NIMH, the National Institutes of Health, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, or the U.S. government.

Many universities or medical schools have affiliated programs that offer treatment options, including training clinics. You can find these programs by searching the website of local university health centers for their psychiatry or psychology departments. You can also go to the website for the health department in your state or county to look for mental health-related programs they might offer.

What are options for digital health care?
The telephone, the internet, and mobile devices have created new opportunities for readily available and accessible treatment, including in areas where mental health professionals may not be physically available. Some of these approaches involve a therapist providing help at a distance. Others, such as web-based programs and mobile apps, are designed to provide immediate information and feedback in the absence of a therapist.
