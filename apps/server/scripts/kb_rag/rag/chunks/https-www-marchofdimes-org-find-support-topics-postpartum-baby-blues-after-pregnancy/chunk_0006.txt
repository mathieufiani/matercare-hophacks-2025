Baby blues are feelings of sadness that you may have in the first few days after having a baby. Up to 4 in 5 new parents (80 percent) have the baby blues. It can affect new parents of any race, age, income, culture or education level. You are not to blame for how you feel. Feeling “blue” does not mean you did anything wrong.

Most people experience baby blues 2 to 3 days after the baby is born. They can last up to 2 weeks. They usually go away on their own, and you don’t need any treatment. If you have sad feelings that last longer than 2 weeks, tell your health care provider. They may want to check you for a more serious condition called postpartum depression. The symptoms of postpartum depression are similar to the baby blues but they’re more severe and last longer.

What causes the baby blues?

Hormone changes that happen after birth may cause the baby blues. After delivery, the amount of the hormones estrogen and progesterone suddenly decreases, causing mood swings. For some people, the hormones made by the thyroid gland may drop sharply, which can make them feel tired and depressed. Not getting enough sleep and not eating well can add to these feelings.

Emotional issues are another possible cause of the baby blues. You may be nervous about taking care of your new baby or be worried about how your life has changed since the baby was born. These thoughts can make you feel sad or depressed.

You may be more at risk for feeling sad after having your baby if you felt depressed during a different pregnancy or at other times in your life.
