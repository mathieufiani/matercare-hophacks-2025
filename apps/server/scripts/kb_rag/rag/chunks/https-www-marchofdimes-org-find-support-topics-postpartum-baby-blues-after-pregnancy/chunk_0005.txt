Baby blues after pregnancy
Postpartum Care
Key Points
If you feel sad or moody in the first few days after having your baby, you may have the baby blues. Many new parents feel this way.
It is normal to feel emotional highs and lows during this time.
Baby blues usually go away by themselves within a week or two of giving birth. You donâ€™t need medical treatment for baby blues.
Baby blues are different than postpartum depression, which is more severe and lasts longer.
If your sad feelings last longer than 2 weeks, tell your health care provider.
