Perinatal psychosis is temporary and treatable with professional help, but it is an emergency, and it is essential that you receive immediate help. If you feel you or someone you know may be suffering from this illness, know that it is not your fault and you are not to blame. It is important to stay with the perinatal individual and the child to ensure everyone’s safety. Call your doctor or an emergency crisis hotline right away so that you can get the help you need.

Risk Factors
The most significant risk factor for perinatal/pospartum psychosis is a personal or family history of bipolar disorder, or a previous psychotic episode. It may also include prolonged lack of sleep (for instance going days without any sleep)

Treatment Options
The majority of individuals who experience perinatal psychosis do not harm themselves or anyone else. However, there is always the risk of danger because psychosis includes delusional thinking and irrational judgment. It is important to stay with the perinatal individual and the child to ensure everyone’s safety. Call your doctor or an emergency crisis hotline right away so that you can get the help you need.
