Immediate treatment for a person going through psychosis is imperative. Individuals experiencing PP are at higher risk of harming themselves or others (including their infant); however, it should be noted that the vast majority do not. This is because the individual experiencing psychosis is experiencing a break from reality. In their psychotic state, the delusions and beliefs make sense to them; delusions feel very real and are often religious. Immediate treatment for someone going through psychosis is imperative.

It is also important to know that many survivors of perinatal psychosis never experienced delusions containing violent commands. Delusions take many forms, and not all of them are destructive. The majority of individuals who experience perinatal psychosis do not harm themselves or anyone else. However, there is always the risk of danger because psychosis includes delusional thinking and irrational judgment, and this is why this illness must be quickly assessed, treated, and carefully monitored by a trained healthcare or perinatal mental health professional.
