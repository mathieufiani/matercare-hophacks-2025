Have you been feeling deeply sad, anxious or overwhelmed since giving birth? Maybe you've had trouble sleeping or eating. You might feel like a robot who's just going through the motions – or you freak out when anyone gets near your newborn.

If some or all of these feelings ring true, I hope you'll be relieved to hear how often this happens to parents. Did you know that 50% to 80% of all people who deliver a child experience the mood shifts known as "the baby blues?" And that 1 in 8 will develop a more serious case of postpartum depression?

These facts can be scary and confusing, especially right after your baby arrives. Your plans for blissful bonding with your child may feel like they've gone out the window—and every day seems like an eternity.

As a mom who went through PPD herself without fully recognizing it, I've made it my mission to learn about the life shifts that happen around pregnancy, delivery and those first few weeks of parenting. All of us need help getting through the intense emotions and dramatic changes that are part of becoming a parent.
