Why should I prioritize my own health when there's sooooo much else on my plate?
First, because your health is absolutely essential to your baby's health, growth and development (and your family's well-being, too). Second, because you deserve to be healthy and happy, especially right now.

If you're feeling guilty as you read this, I encourage you to offer yourself the same compassion you'd give your loved ones if they were in your shoes. Parenting isn't about burying your needs while caring for everyone else's. It's a continuous flow of giving and receiving. Needing help doesn't make you weak—but seeking out help is a profound act of strength.

Does postpartum depression only affect first-time parents?
Like many moms, I experienced PPD after the birth of my second child. It wasn't simply because I suddenly had two kids in diapers or was struggling to get quality sleep. The adjustments that new parents go through with each birth can be complex and intense, so if you're wondering why you're struggling to cope as your family grows, realize you're one of many, many experienced parents who do.

Do adoptive parents sometimes get depressed?
Naturally they do—because creating or adding to a family always means grappling with strong emotions and demanding new routines. Caring for a newborn is no less challenging for adoptive parents than for birth parents. And the long, often exhausting process of adopting a child can produce such high levels of stress that many parents feel completely worn out by the time their baby arrives.
