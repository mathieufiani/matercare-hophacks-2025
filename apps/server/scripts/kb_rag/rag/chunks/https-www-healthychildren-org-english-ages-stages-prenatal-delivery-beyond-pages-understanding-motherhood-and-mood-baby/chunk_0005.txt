Where can I find effective treatment for postpartum depression?
Consider starting with your pediatrician, who truly understands what you're going through, both medically and personally. If you feel more comfortable approaching your ob-gyn or primary care doctor, that's fine too. It is also good to talk with someone close to you who you trust, like a partner, parent, friend or family member, how you're feeling. The main thing is not to chalk it up to a normal part of parenthood. Seek care as soon as you can, since depression rarely disappears on its own. You're not supposed to tough it out alone.

Treatment for PPD or perinatal depression may include talk therapy, support groups, and discussions with friends and family about what you need while recovering. Light exercise and calming practices such as yoga and meditation can help. You may also receive a prescription for antidepressants, many of which are safe to take while breastfeeding.

Keep in mind that these medications provide short-term support while you regain your balance. They're not a crutch, just one part of the treatment plan that millions of people follow when they're experiencing depression.
