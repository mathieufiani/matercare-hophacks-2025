How will I know if it's postpartum depression?
Lots of new parents ask me about the baby blues, depression and how to tell the difference. I explain that mood swings are very common after giving birth, especially in the first 2 weeks. What separates the blues from postpartum depression (PPD) is the length of time you're suffering and how severely you're affected.

Hormonal shifts that happen right after birth can make you feel incredibly sad, tearful, overwhelmed and confused. Pair this with the 24/7 challenges of caring for an infant and you have the perfect storm of biological triggers that can lead to mood changes.

The baby blues tend to disappear after a few days or weeks, and while they can be frightening, getting enough rest and accepting plenty of family and social support helps most parents recover. But if the raw feelings and fatigue just won't go away, you may be experiencing PPD.

Many new parents also experience anxiety that goes well beyond just being nervous about having a baby. In fact, the excessive and continued worrying of post-partum anxiety is as common as PPD, and may even happen at the same time.

Can depression start before my baby arrives?
Absolutely. Even though we hear a lot about postpartum mood swings, many pregnant people become depressed before giving birth. The name for this is perinatal depression, and it is similar to PPD in terms of the symptoms you feel and the treatment you may need.
