What does postpartum depression look like in real life?
Parents who develop depression before or after giving birth experience deep sadness, confusion, loss of energy and a sense of hopelessness about the future. You may have angry outbursts or moments when everything gets under your skin.

Difficulty sleeping is another sign of depression—and while it's always hard to get enough rest with a new baby, depression makes it especially hard for you to fall asleep and stay there. You may wake feeling you've never even gotten a wink, leaving you to struggle through your day without the energy and positive mood that make parenting so much easier.

Changes in appetite and eating habits also come with depression. Many new parents don't feel like eating at all, or they binge on carb-laden snacks for energy or comfort. Caffeine, sugar and other short-term boosts can make matters worse, since they can disrupt your sleep and cause your energy to crash multiple times during the day.

Depression can also make you feel agitated and mistrustful, pushing you over the edge when anyone tries to help with the baby or handle simple chores around the house. Feelings of guilt, shame and blame can even make you feel you don't deserve help—and this is when things can take a turn for the worse.
