Medications
When discussing medications with your provider, let him or her know if you are pregnant, thinking about becoming pregnant, or breastfeeding. You and your provider can decide if taking medications while pregnant or breastfeeding is right for you. Visit Medications and Pregnancy for more information.

Helping loved ones with depression
To support someone who has depression, help her get the appropriate diagnosis and treatment. You may need to make an appointment and go with her to see her health care provider. If someone you know has depression, see How Can I Help a Loved One Who Is Depressed? For information about helping a loved one in crisis, see the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline's Help for Someone Else.

Also, remember that if you know someone who is depressed, it may affect you too. It is important to take care of yourself as well. For additional resources on depression or postpartum depression, see Resources.
