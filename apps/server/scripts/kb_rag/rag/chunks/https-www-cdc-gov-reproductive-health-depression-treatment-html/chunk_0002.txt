Talking to your health care provider
If you think you may be depressed, the first step to seeking treatment is to talk to your health care provider. Remember that depression is not your fault. By asking for support, you are helping yourself and your family.

woman talking to a health care provider
If you think you may be depressed, talk to your health care provider.
Ways to begin the conversation include "I read this information, and it sounds like how I feel. Can you help me find out if I have depression?" "I don't feel like myself. Could it be depression?"

In response, your health care provider should:

Ask several more questions about how you are feeling and acting.
Talk with you about treatment options.
Provide the name and number of a mental health specialist.
You can also visit CDC's resources to find help in your area. After your visit, make sure to follow up on all referrals and treatment that your health care provider suggests.
