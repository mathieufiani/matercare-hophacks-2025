How common is postpartum depression?

How do I know if I have postpartum depression?
Some normal changes after pregnancy can cause symptoms similar to those of depression. Many mothers feel overwhelmed when a new baby comes home. But if you have any of the following symptoms of depression for more than 2 weeks, call your doctor, nurse, or midwife:

Feeling angry or moody
Feeling sad or hopeless
Feeling guilty, shameful, or worthless
Eating more or less than usual
Sleeping more or less than usual
Unusual crying or sadness
Loss of interest, joy, or pleasure in thing you used to enjoy
Withdrawing from friends and family
Possible thoughts of harming the baby or yourself
Some women don’t tell anyone about their symptoms. New mothers may feel embarrassed, ashamed, or guilty about feeling depressed when they are supposed to be happy. They may also worry they will be seen as bad mothers. Any woman can become depressed during pregnancy or after having a baby. It doesn’t mean you are a bad mom. You don’t have to suffer. There is help. Your doctor can help you figure out whether your symptoms are caused by depression or something else.
