What is the difference between “baby blues” and postpartum depression?
Many women have the baby blues in the days after childbirth. If you have the baby blues, you may:

Have mood swings
Feel sad, anxious, or overwhelmed
Have crying spells
Lose your appetite
Have trouble sleeping
The baby blues usually go away within a few days. The symptoms of postpartum depression last longer, are more severe, and may require treatment by a health care professional. Postpartum depression usually begins within the first month after birth.

What should I do if I have symptoms of postpartum depression?
Call your doctor, nurse, midwife, or pediatrician if:

Your baby blues symptoms don’t go away after 2 weeks or are very intense
Symptoms of depression begin within 1 year of delivery and last more than 2 weeks
It is difficult to work or get things done at home
You cannot care for yourself or your baby (e.g., eating, sleeping, bathing)
You have thoughts about hurting yourself or your baby
Ask your partner or a loved one to call for you if necessary. Your doctor, nurse, or midwife can ask you questions to test for depression. They can also refer you to a mental health professional for help and treatment.
