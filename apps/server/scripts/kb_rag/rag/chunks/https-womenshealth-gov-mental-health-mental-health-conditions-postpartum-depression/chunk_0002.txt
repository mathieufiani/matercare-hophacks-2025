Postpartum depression

Your body and mind go through many changes during and after pregnancy. If you feel sad, anxious, or overwhelmed or feel like you don’t love or care for your baby and these feelings last longer than 2 weeks during or after pregnancy, you may have postpartum depression. Treatment for depression, such as therapy or medicine, works and can help you and your baby be as healthy as possible in the future.

What is postpartum depression?
“Postpartum” means the time after having a baby. Some women get the “baby blues,” or feel sad, worried, or tired within a few days of giving birth. For many women, the baby blues go away in a few days. If these feelings don’t go away or you feel sad, hopeless, or anxious for longer than 2 weeks, you may have postpartum depression. Feeling hopeless after childbirth is not a regular or expected part of being a mother.

Postpartum depression is a serious mental health condition that involves the brain and affects your behavior and physical health. If you have depression, then sad and hopeless feelings don’t go away and can interfere with your day-to-day life. You might not feel connected to your baby, as if you are not the baby’s mother, or you might not love or care for the baby. These feelings can be mild to severe.
