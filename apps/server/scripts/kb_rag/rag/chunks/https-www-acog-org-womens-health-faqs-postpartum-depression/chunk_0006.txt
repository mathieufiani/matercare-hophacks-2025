What happens in talk therapy?
In talk therapy (also called psychotherapy), you and a mental health professional talk about your feelings and discuss how to manage them. Sometimes, therapy is needed for only a few weeks, but it may be needed for a few months or longer.

What are the types of talk therapy?
You may have one-on-one therapy with just you and the therapist or group therapy where you meet with a therapist and other people with conditions similar to yours. Another option is family or couples therapy, in which you and your family members or your partner may work with a therapist.

What can be done to help prevent postpartum depression in women with a history of depression?
If you have a history of depression at any time in your life or if you are taking an antidepressant, tell your ob-gyn early in your prenatal care. Ideally, you should tell them before you get pregnant. They may suggest that you begin treatment right after you give birth to prevent postpartum depression. 

If you were taking antidepressants before pregnancy, your ob-gyn can help you decide whether to continue taking medication during your pregnancy.
