Can zuranolone cause side effects?
Yes. Common side effects include dizziness, fatigue, drowsiness, diarrhea, cold-like symptoms, and urinary tract infections (UTIs). Also, you should use birth control during treatment and for 1 week after the last dose. It’s important to avoid pregnancy because this medication may cause harm to a fetus. In addition, you should avoid

driving or other tasks that require you to be alert (avoid these tasks for 12 hours after each dose)

alcohol, opioid medication, some antidepressants, and some medications for anxiety, seizures, and other problems with the nervous system

Talk with your ob-gyn about all the medications you take.

Can zuranolone pass to a baby through breast milk?
Zuranolone passes into breast milk. It’s not clear how the medication affects milk production or breastfed babies. If you are breastfeeding, talk with your ob-gyn about your options. You may be able to continue breastfeeding for the 14 days of treatment. Or you may decide to pause breastfeeding and go back to it after you are 1 week past your last dose of zuranolone.
