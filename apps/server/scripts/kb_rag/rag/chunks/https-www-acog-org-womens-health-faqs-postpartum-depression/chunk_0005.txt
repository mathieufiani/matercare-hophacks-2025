What are antidepressants?
Antidepressants are medications that work to balance the chemicals in the brain that control moods. There are many types of antidepressants. Drugs sometimes are combined when needed to get the best results. It may take 3–4 weeks of taking the medication before you start to feel better.

Can antidepressants cause side effects?
Antidepressants can cause side effects, but most are temporary and go away after a short time. If you have severe or unusual side effects that affect daily life, call your ob-gyn or another health care professional. You may need to try another type of antidepressant.

If your depression worsens soon after starting medication or if you have thoughts of hurting yourself or others, call your ob-gyn, another health care professional, or emergency medical services right away.

Can antidepressants pass to a baby through breast milk?
Antidepressants pass into breast milk. The levels of medication found in breast milk generally are very low. Breastfeeding has many benefits for both you and your baby. Deciding to take an antidepressant while breastfeeding involves weighing these benefits against the potential risks of your baby being exposed to the medication in your breast milk. Talk with your ob-gyn about breastfeeding while you’re taking an antidepressant.
