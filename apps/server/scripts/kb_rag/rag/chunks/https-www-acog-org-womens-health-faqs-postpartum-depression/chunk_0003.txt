Fatigue—Fatigue (being very tired) may be a major contributor to postpartum depression. Many people feel very tired after giving birth, and it can take weeks to regain strength and energy. Recovery can take even longer after cesarean birth.

Lifestyle factors—Lack of support from others and stressful life events, such as a recent death of a loved one, a family illness, or moving to a new city, can greatly increase the risk of postpartum depression.

I think I have postpartum depression. What should I do?
Call your obstetrician–gynecologist (ob-gyn) or another health care professional right away if you think you may have postpartum depression, or if your partner or family members are concerned that you do. Do not wait until your postpartum checkup to talk with your ob-gyn.

How is postpartum depression treated?
