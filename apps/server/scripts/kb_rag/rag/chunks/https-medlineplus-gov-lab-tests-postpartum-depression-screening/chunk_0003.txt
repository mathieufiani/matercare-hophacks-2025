What happens during a postpartum depression screening?
You may have a postpartum depression screening as part of a routine checkup after giving birth. Your baby's provider may also screen you for postpartum depression at your baby's routine well-infant visits.

During the screening you'll answer a set of questions. Your provider may ask the questions, or you may fill out a questionnaire form to discuss with your provider later. One of the most common questionnaires is called the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS). The EPDS includes 10 questions about your mood and thoughts.

Your provider may also order a blood test to find out if a physical condition, such as hyperthyroidism or hypothyroidism, may be causing your depression.

During a blood test, a health care professional will take a blood sample from a vein in your arm, using a small needle. After the needle is inserted, a small amount of blood will be collected into a test tube or vial. You may feel a little sting when the needle goes in or out. This usually takes less than five minutes.
