Will I need to do anything to prepare for a postpartum depression screening?
You usually don't need any special preparations for a postpartum depression screening.

Are there any risks to screening?
There is no risk to having a physical exam or taking a questionnaire.

There is very little risk to having a blood test. You may have slight pain or bruising at the spot where the needle was put in, but most symptoms go away quickly.

What do the results mean?
If your screening shows you may have postpartum depression, it's important to get treatment as soon as possible. You may need treatment from a mental health provider. A mental health provider is a health care professional who specializes in diagnosing and treating mental health problems.

Along with medicine and talk therapy, there are things you can do at home that may help you feel better, such as:

Asking for help caring for the baby and doing other household chores
Spending time with other adults
Taking time for yourself
Resting when the baby rests
