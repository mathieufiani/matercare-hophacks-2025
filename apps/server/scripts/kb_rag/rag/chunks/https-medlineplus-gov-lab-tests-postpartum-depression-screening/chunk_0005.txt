Is there anything else I need to know about a postpartum depression screening?
You may have heard the terms "perinatal depression" and "peripartum depression." They both describe depression that happens either during pregnancy or just after birth. Research shows that depression during pregnancy increases your risk of postpartum depression. To help prevent postpartum depression, some medical experts recommend depression screening during routine pregnancy checkups.

A rare but more serious form of postpartum depression is called postpartum psychosis. Postpartum psychosis may cause hallucinations (seeing or hearing things that aren't real) and confusion. It is a medical emergency and it's important to get help immediately by calling 911 or going to the nearest emergency room.
