Discussion
Postpartum anxiety affects approximately 8.5% of women globally, and depression occurs in 10% to 15%, collectively posing critical threats to maternal and infant health.[24,25] These disorders impair motherâ€“infant bonding, disrupt breastfeeding continuity, and increase the risk of long-term cognitive and emotional sequelae in offspring.[2,4] The findings of this study revealed that light music effectively prevents these psychological burdens, modulates stress responses, and enhances functional outcomes.

Postpartum anxiety and depression are primarily caused by rapid hormonal changes, such as sharp declines in estrogen, progesterone, and thyroid hormone levels, as well as social and familial factors.[2,4] Primiparous women, due to their lack of experience in adapting to maternal roles, often experience heightened psychological stress, which leads to higher rates of postpartum anxiety and depression.[26] However, conventional nursing methods face limitations, including lactation safety concerns associated with antidepressants and accessibility barriers to psychotherapy.[6]
