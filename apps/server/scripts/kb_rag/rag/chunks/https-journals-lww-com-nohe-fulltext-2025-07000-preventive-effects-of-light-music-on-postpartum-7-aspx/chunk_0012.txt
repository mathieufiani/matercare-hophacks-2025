Psychological Outcomes
Psychological outcomes revealed significant intergroup differences over time [Table 2]. Baseline scores of EPDS and PASS did not differ between groups (P > 0.05). At 6 weeks postpartum, the music therapy group showed lower EPDS and PASS scores compared to the standard care group (P all < 0.05).

EPDS = Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale, PASS = Perinatal Self-Rating Anxiety Scale; *Compared to 3-day postpartum, P < 0.05.

No significant intergroup differences were observed in the incidence of depression (EDPS score >13) and anxiety (PASS score >21) at 3 days postpartum (P > 0.05). At 6 weeks postpartum, the music therapy group demonstrated a depression incidence comparable to that of the standard care group (4.84% vs. 12.07%, χ2 = 2.051, P = 0.152). However, the music therapy group demonstrated a significantly lower anxiety incidence compared to the standard care group (6.45% vs. 20.69%, χ2 = 5.257, P = 0.022). These results highlight the progressive preventive efficacy of music therapy against postpartum psychological disorders.
