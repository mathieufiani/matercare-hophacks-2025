Cortisol and sAA levels reflect the body’s stress response.[33] Psychological stress activates the hypothalamic–pituitary–adrenal (HPA) axis, increases cortisol production, and promotes sAA release.[34] HPA axis hyperactivity, commonly observed in postpartum anxiety and depression, creates a self-perpetuating cycle of stress reactivity and psychological distress.[35] Our findings revealed that women who received music therapy had lower cortisol and sAA levels than those in the standard care group. These findings align with previous studies indicating that music can reduce cortisol levels in peripartum women.[36] Music may interrupt this cycle by modulating autonomic nervous system activity, and research has shown decreased sympathetic and increased parasympathetic activation following music exposure.[35] Elevated cortisol levels correlate positively with severity of anxiety and depression.[37,38] The concurrent reduction in cortisol and sAA suggests that music therapy simultaneously targets the HPA axis and sympathetic nervous system, resulting in a comprehensive attenuation of the stress response.

Poor sleep quality and insomnia exhibit a bidirectional relationship with anxiety and depression, which often coexist as comorbid conditions.[39,40] Improving sleep quality is a validated strategy for mitigating these disorders.[41] Our findings indicated that music therapy significantly improves sleeping quality. Beyond neurotransmitter regulation, music may enhance sleep by activating the parasympathetic nervous system and slowing heart and respiratory rates to induce relaxation.[42,43] Music can also mask environmental noise and create a tranquil sleep environment.[42] Similarly, breastfeeding and mental health share a complex interplay in postpartum women. Breastfeeding increases the releases of oxytocin and prolactin—hormones that strengthen mother–infant bonding and reduce anxiety.[44,45] Conversely, postpartum anxiety and depression can disrupt lactation by altering hormone levels, undermining breastfeeding confidence, and further reducing milk supply.[44] A systematic review indicated that music incorporating nurturing themes or gentle melodies can enhance milk production, aligning with our findings of improved breastfeeding efficacy.[46] These results suggested music’s dual role in emotional regulation and lactation support. Finally, higher quality-of-life scores in the music therapy group comprehensively reflect its multifaceted benefits in postpartum care. While significant reductions in anxiety symptoms and improvements in physiological markers were observed, the difference in clinically significant depression rates between groups did not reach statistical significance at 6 weeks postpartum, although a clear trend was evident (12.07% vs. 4.84%). This outcome may reflect insufficient statistical power for categorical outcomes with low baseline prevalence, suggesting that larger sample sizes may be needed to detect significant differences in clinical depression rates.
