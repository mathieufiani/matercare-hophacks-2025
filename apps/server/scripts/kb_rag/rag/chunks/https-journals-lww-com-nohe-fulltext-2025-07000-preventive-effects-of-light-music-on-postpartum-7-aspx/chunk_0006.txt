The music therapy group received structured light music therapy in addition to standard postpartum care. A hospital-curated music library comprising 32 instrumental tracks (mean duration 4.2 ± 1.2 min) was utilized based on previous experiences,[15] featuring classical compositions and culturally adapted folk melodies. Participants selected their preferred genres from the music library via a tablet-based interface during admission, with options updated daily to minimize habituation. Music therapy was initiated within 24 hours postpartum. Sessions were conducted twice daily (09:00–09:30 and 17:00–17:30) in private postpartum rooms using noise-canceling headphones (Bose, QuietComfort 35 II, USA), and playback volume was calibrated to 40 to 45 dB. Each 30-minute session began with 5 minutes of breathing exercises guided by the nurses. The breathing exercises consisted of (1) a 1-minute preparatory phase (sitting upright with hands placed on the lower ribs to monitor diaphragmatic movement); (2) a 3-minute rhythmic breathing phase (inhale for 4 seconds through the nose, hold for 2 seconds, and exhale for 6 seconds through pursed lips at a 6–8 breaths/min pace); and (3) a 1-minute recovery phase (natural breathing). This was followed by continuous music playback. Nursing staff documented real-time adherence through a checklist system, confirming proper device placement and ensuring environmental quietness (background noise <55 dB).

Post-discharge continuity was maintained through a loaned audio device (Sony, NW-A105 Walkman, Japan) with preloaded tracks, synchronized to the original nursing schedule. Additionally, participants received weekly 15- to 20-minute online counseling sessions focused on stress management techniques. Compliance after discharge was monitored through a mobile application—WeChat (Tencent Inc., China). Participants were required to send the information of time, duration, and specific tracks they listened to during each session to a specific WeChat chat group. Self-reported adherence was verified during weekly follow-up calls.
