Nonpharmacological approaches such as music therapy have gained attention for their safety and acceptability. A neuroimaging study revealed that structured musical stimuli enhance prefrontal–amygdala connectivity and promote top–down regulation of stress responses.[8] A systematic review in nonperinatal populations demonstrated significant reductions in anxiety and cortisol levels following music-based therapy.[9] In obstetric care, music therapy has shown promise in labor pain management and prenatal stress reduction.[10] A previous study reported a decrease in pain levels among laboring women exposed to self-selected music.[10] While preliminary evidence supports music’s potential in mental health, critical gaps remain regarding its effects on postpartum emotional well-being.[10,11] Despite existing studies on music therapy during pregnancy and labor, research specifically targeting the prevention of postpartum anxiety and depression in primiparous women remains insufficient—particularly studies that examine psychological outcomes and physiological biomarkers alongside functional measures such as breastfeeding success.[12]

This retrospective cohort study addressed these research gaps by using a light music therapy protocol at 3 days and 6 weeks postpartum. The 6-week duration was selected because most cases of postpartum depression and anxiety emerge within the first 6 weeks after delivery.[2] This paper hypothesizes that light music reduces postpartum anxiety and depression in primiparous women, improves physiological stress, enhances breastfeeding outcomes, and elevates overall quality of life compared with standard care. By analyzing psychological scales, stress biomarkers, and breastfeeding efficacy, this study aims to clarify the clinical utility of music therapy in postpartum emotion regulation.
