Our study found that the music therapy group showed significantly milder anxiety and depressive symptoms at 6 weeks postpartum compared with the standard care group. Additionally, the proportion of participants screening positive for clinically significant anxiety and depression was markedly lower in the music therapy group. These results aligned with previous studies demonstrating therapeutic effects of music on anxiety and depression.[27,28] However, prior research primarily focused on treating diagnosed cases, whereas this study highlights the preventive role of music. The mood-enhancing effects of music may stem from its ability to modulate neurotransmitters such as dopamine, serotonin, and endorphins.[29] Dopamine release during pleasurable music listening mediates reward processing and motivation.[30] Serotonin levels, which are often depleted in depression, may be stabilized through regular music exposure, contributing to improved mood stability and reduced anxiety.[30] Additionally, music stimulates the production of endogenous opioids such as β-endorphins, which provide analgesic effects and generate feelings of pleasure and well-being.[30] These neurochemical changes collectively form the biological basis for music’s therapeutic effects on postpartum psychological health. Studies also suggested that soothing music can reduce amygdala activation, thereby alleviating anxiety and depressive symptoms.[31,32]
