Physiological Outcomes
Salivary cortisol and alpha-amylase measurement: Saliva was collected between 07:00 and 08:00 a.m. to control for diurnal variation. Participants were asked to refrain from eating, drinking, or brushing their teeth for 30 minutes prior to sampling. Saliva samples were centrifuged at 3000 × g for 15 minutes (Eppendorf 5430R, Germany) and stored at −80°C until analysis. Salivary cortisol levels were quantified using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay using a high-sensitivity salivary cortisol kit (Salimetrics, Catalog No. 1-3002, USA). The absorbance was measured at 450 nm, with 620 nm as the reference wavelength, using a SpectraMax M5 microplate reader (Molecular Devices, USA). The assay has a lower limit of sensitivity of 0.007 µg/dL, with intra-assay coefficients of variation <7% and inter-assay coefficients of variation <10%. Salivary alpha-amylase (sAA) activity was analyzed using kinetic assays on the same samples. After thawing, 20 µL of saliva was mixed with 100 µL of substrate solution (α-amylase FS Kit, DiaSys Diagnostic Systems GmbH, Germany) containing 4,6-ethylidene-G7PNP. Absorbance at 405 nm was monitored every 30 seconds for 5 minutes using a UV-1800 spectrophotometer (Shimadzu Corporation, Japan). Enzyme activity (U/mL) was calculated based on the rate of substrate hydrolysis. Laboratory personnel analyzing salivary samples were blinded to group allocation to prevent measurement bias.

Breastfeeding Efficacy
Exclusive breastfeeding (EBF) was defined as infant nutrition derived solely from breast milk, without formula supplementation. EBF rates at 3 days and 6 weeks postpartum were calculated based on maternal self-reports.

Quality of Life
Quality of life was assessed using the World Health Organization Quality of Life Brief Version (WHOQOL-BREF) scale, with a Cronbach’s α = 0.89.[22,23] The 26-item tool evaluates four domains: physical health, psychological well-being, social relationships, and environmental factors. Each item was rated on a 5-point Likert scale ranging from 1 (very poor) to 5 (very good). The scoring for each domain was calculated as follows: the mean score for each domain was obtained by summing the item scores within the domain and dividing by the number of items. The mean score was then multiplied by 4 to obtain the domain score. The domain scores were then transformed into a 0 to 100 scale using the following formula: Transformed score = [(Domain score − Minimum possible score)/(Maximum possible score − Minimum possible score)] × 100. A higher score indicates better functioning.
