This study has several limitations. The retrospective design introduces potential selection bias, as group allocation was based on clinical practice rather than randomization. Additionally, the single-center sample may limit the generalizability to diverse cultural or healthcare settings because the findings primarily reflect outcomes in a specific cultural context and healthcare system, and may limit their applicability to populations with different perinatal care practices or cultural attitudes towards music. Adherence to post-discharge music sessions was self-reported via a mobile application, which may have introduced measurement inaccuracies. Despite the authors’ efforts to document certain confounding variables, other factors—such as exposure to music outside the nursing protocol and different home environments after discharge (e.g., partner support and infant temperament)—could not be fully controlled, all of which might influence psychological outcomes. While participants were able to select their preferred music genres from our library, the predetermined selection may not have optimally matched individual preferences, potentially affecting nursing efficacy and participant engagement. Future research should priorities multicenter randomized trials with extended follow-up periods to evaluate the sustained effects. Prospective randomized controlled trials with stratification by baseline psychological measures, extended follow-up periods of 6 and 12 months to assess long-term preventive effects, and investigation of dose–response relationships between music exposure and psychological outcomes are recommended. Incorporating objective adherence monitoring tools, such as smartwatch-based music playback tracking, could enhance data reliability. Additionally, future studies should utilize personalized music delivery via smartphone applications with preference-learning algorithms to accommodate individual musical tastes, explore cultural adaptations of music selections for diverse populations, and systematically control for environmental and family support variables through structured assessments and matched controls. Investigating neuroimaging markers as mediators of music’s psychological effects would also provide valuable mechanistic insights into this promising nursing approach.
