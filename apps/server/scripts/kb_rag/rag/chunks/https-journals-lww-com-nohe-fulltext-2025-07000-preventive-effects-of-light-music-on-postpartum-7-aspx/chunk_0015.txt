Breastfeeding Efficacy and Quality of Life
At 6 weeks postpartum, the music therapy group had a higher EBF rate than the standard care group (79.03% vs. 53.45%, P = 0.003). Baseline (3-day) WHOQOL-BREF scores showed no intergroup differences across all domains (P > 0.05). At 6 weeks postpartum, the music group demonstrated significantly higher scores in physical health, psychological well-being, social relationship, and environmental factors (P all <0.05, Table 5). These findings suggest that music therapy can deliver clinically significant benefits that extend beyond symptom reduction to enhance mother–infant bonding and overall postpartum experience.
