Postpartum Depression
What Is Postpartum Depression?
In the first few weeks of caring for a newborn, most new moms feel anxious, sad, frustrated, tired, and overwhelmed. Sometimes known as the "baby blues," these feelings get better within a few weeks. But for some women, they are very strong or don't get better. Postpartum depression is when these feelings don't go away after about 2 weeks or make it hard for a woman to take care of her baby.

It's not anyone's fault or a weakness when a woman gets postpartum depression. Postpartum depression is treatable. Treatment helps most women feel like themselves again. Then they can enjoy having a new baby at home.
