What Causes Postpartum Depression?
Postpartum depression is caused by a combination of:

hormonal changes that happen after a baby is born
changes such as the loss of sleep and increased stress that come with taking care of a newborn baby
Postpartum depression can affect any woman â€” but some may be more at risk for developing it. Women who have had any kind of depression in the past (including postpartum depression) or who have a family history of depression are more likely to get postpartum depression.

Other things that might increase the chance of postpartum depression include serious stress during the pregnancy, medical problems during the pregnancy or after birth, and lack of support at home.
